# GSID Class
 
GSID Class is a generic auto-counter and generator for HTMLElement **id** attributes making sure every generated id is unique.
 
it is used internally, and only required for developers when creating their own custom WebComponents.
 
When extending GSElement, there is no need to use GSID unless it is required to add unique **id** to a generated HTML code.
